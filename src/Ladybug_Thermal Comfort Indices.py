        _location: Input data from Ladybug's "Import epw" "location" output, or create your own location data with Ladybug's "Construct Location" component.
        _dryBulbTemperature: Air temperature.
                             Input a single value or a whole list from "Import epw" component's "dryBulbTemperature" output.
                             -
                             In Celsius degrees (C).
        meanRadiantTemperature_: An average temperature of the surfaces that surround the analysis location.
                                 For indoor conditions or outdoor in-shade, it should be equal to air temperature. So just input the same data you inputted to "_dryBulbTemperature".
                                 -
                                 If nothing supplied, it will be calculated for outdoor conditions (both in-shade and out-shade).
                                 -
                                 In Celsius degrees (C).
        dewPointTemperature_: Dew point temperature.
                              Input a single value or a whole list from "Import epw" component's "dewPointTemperature" output.
                              -
                              If not supplied, it will be calculated from _dryBulbTemperature and relativeHumidity_ data.
                              -
                              In Celsius degrees (C).
        relativeHumidity_: Relative humidity.
                           Input a single value or a whole list from "Import epw" component's "relativeHumidity" output.
                           -
                           If not supplied 50% will be used as a default (indoor conditions).
                           -
                           In percent (from 0% to 110%).
        windSpeed_: Wind speed at 1.1 meters height from analysis surface (height of standing persons gravity center). It can be a single value or a list of values.
                    Take the "windSpeed" output from "Import epw" component and plug it to "Wind Speed Calculator" component's "_windSpeed_tenMeters" input. Set the "heightAboveGround_" input to "1.1". Then plug in the data from "Wind Speed Calculator" component's "windSpeedAtHeight" output to this component's "windSpeed_" input.
                    In this way we converted the 10 meter wind speed from the .epw file to required 1.1m.
                    -
                    If not supplied, default value of 0.3 m/s is used (meaning: the analysis is conducted in outdoor no wind conditions, or indoor conditions).
                    -
                    In meters/second.
        totalSkyCover_: Amount of sky dome covered by clouds.
                        Input a single value or a whole list from "Import epw" component's "totalSkyCover" output.
                        It ranges from from 1 to 10. For example: 1 is 1/10 covered. 10 is total coverage (10/10).
                        -
                        If not supplied 6/10 will be used (cloud coverage of temperate humid climate).
                        -
                        In tenths of sky cover.
        solarRadiationPerHour_:  Amount of solar radiation that an analysis person received.
                                 -
                                 1) If you would like to do an analysis accounted for shading (more precise) use the "Sunpath shading" component and its "shadedSolarRadiationPerHour" output.
                                 Or use "Radiation Analysis" component's "radiationResult" output. Be sure to scale the "radiationResult" output data 1000 times (to convert it from kW/m2 to W/m2).
                                 The "Sunpath shading" component will account for partial shading from the trees, while "Radiation Analysis" will not.
                                 -
                                 2) If you would not like to do an analysis accounted for shading (because it's quicker that way), then you can simply supply the data from "Import epw" component's "diffuseHorizontalRadiation" output. In this way it will be assumed that an analysis is being conducted in outdoor in-shade conditions, or indoor conditions.
                                 -
                                 If nothing supplied, default value of 0 Wh/m2 will be used (no solar radiation at all).
                                 -
                                 In Wh/m2.
        bodyCharacteristics_: A list of body characteristics in the following order: age, sex, height, weight, bodyPosition, clothingInsulation, acclimated, metabolicRate, activityDuration.
                              Use Ladybug's "Body Characteristics" component to generate it.
                              -
                              If not supplied, the following default values will be used:
                              --
                              35 - age
                              "male" - sex
                              175 - height in centimeters
                              75 - weight in kilograms
                              "standing" - bodyPosition
                              None (clothingInsulation - "None" means that it will be calculated based on air temperature)
                              37 - clothingAlbedo in % (for medium colored clothes)
                              "unacclimated" - acclimated
                              2.32 - metabolicRate in mets (2.32 corresponds to walking 4km/h)
                              480 - activityDuration in minutes
        HOY_: An hour (or hours) of the year for which you would like to calculate thermal indices. These hours must be a value between 1 and 8760.
              This input will override the analysisPeriod_ input below.
              -
              If not supplied, this input will be ignored.
        analysisPeriod_: An optional analysis period from the "Analysis Period" component.
                         -
                         If not supplied, the whole year period will be used as an analysis period.
        _runIt: ...
        
    output:
        readMe!: If your _comfortIndex is set to either 15 or 16, and you are performing analysis for a single hour, then this output will show additional results related with PET (Physiological Equivalent Temperature).
        comfortIndexValue: The value of the chosen comfort.
        comfortIndexLevel: The level (category, sensation) of the chosen index.
        comfortableOrNot: Indication of whether that person is comfortable (1) or not (0) at particular hour.
        percentComfortable: Percentage of time, during which chosen index falls into the comfortable category.
        percentHotExtreme: Percentage of time, during which chosen index falls into the hot extreme category.
        percentColdExtreme: Percentage of time, during which chosen index falls into the cold extreme category.
