"""
Use this component to set the camera location and direction for the Rhino "Perspective" viewport.
Here is the video that shows how it works: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mmhz867zY8
-
Provided by Ladybug 0.0.66
    
    Args:
        _cameraLocation: A point representing the location of the viewport camera.
        _cameraDirection: A vector that represents the direction that the viewport camera should face.
        uvLookAround_: Optional UV coordinates to tilt the viewport camera off from from the input _cameraDirection. Values for UV coordinates must be between -1 and 1 and these correspond to a tilt of 180 degrees in either direction.  It is recommended that you use a Grasshopper sliderMD comonent for input.
        lensLength_: An optional float number that sets the lens length of the viewport camera.
        
    Returns:
