"""
Use this component to calculate a steady state interior surface temperature from given conditions and surface U-Values.
-
Provided by Ladybug 0.0.63
    
    Args:
        _outTemp: The outdoor air temperature in degrees Celcius.
        _inTemp: The indoor air temperature in degrees Celcius.
        _uValue: The U-Value of the surface dividing the interior and exterior in SI (W/Km2).
        intEmiss_: A number between 0 and 1 that represents the interior emissivity of the surface dividing the interior and exterior.  The default is set to 0.9 for a non-metallic surface.
        srfOrient_: A number between 180 (downwards) and -180 (upwards) that represents the angle in degrees of the direction of heat flow.  This is related to the orientation of the surface dividing the interior and exterior. This input can also be the normal vector of a surface that is facing the correct direction of heat flow.  The default is set to 0 degrees for a verically-oriented surface (horizontal heat flow).
    Returns:
        filmCoeff: The interior film coefficient as calculated by the interior emissivity, surface orientation and Chapter 26, Table 10 of AHSHRAE Fundemantals.
        inSrfTemp: The steady state interior surface temperature in degrees Celcius.
