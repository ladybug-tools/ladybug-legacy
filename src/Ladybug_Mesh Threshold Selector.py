"""
Use this component to delete out unwanted areas of a shade after a shade benefit evaluation has been run.  This will help turn your shade evaluation results into an actual shade brep based on a percentage of beneficial shade cells that you decide.

-
Provided by Ladybug 0.0.63
    
    Args:
        _inputMesh: The mesh for which you would like to highlight the portion that meets a threshold.
        _analysisResult: A numerical data set whose length corresponds to the number of faces in the _inputMesh.
        percentToKeep_: A number between 0 and 100 that represents the percentage of the mesh faces that you would like to include in the resulting newColoredMesh.  By default, this is set to 25%.
        levelOfPerform_: An optional number that represents the threshold above which a given mesh face is included in the newColoredMesh.  An input here will override the percent input above.
    Returns:
        readMe!: ...
        totalValue: The sum of all of the values that meet the criteria multiplied by the mesh face area.  For example, if the _inputMesh is a radiation study mesh, this is equal to the total radiation falling on the newColoredMesh.  For an energy shade benefit mesh, this is the total energy saved by a shade of this size.
        areaMeetsThresh: The area of the newColoredMesh in Rhino model units.
        newColoredMesh: A new colored mesh with the vlues below the threshold deleted out of it.
        newMeshOutline: A set of curves outlining the portion of the mesh that is above the threshold.
