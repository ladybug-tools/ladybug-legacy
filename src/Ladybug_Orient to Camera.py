"""
Use this component to generate a plane that is oriented perpendicular to the active Rhino viewport camera direction and centered at an input _initPosition point.
This is useful for orienting geometry Grasshopper to the Rhino viewport camera, which may help in presenting certain Ladybug visualizations in Rhino.
Connect a Grasshopper "Timer" component to the refresh_ input of this component in order to get a real time update of the oriented plane based on the Rhino viewport camera direction.
-
Provided by Ladybug 0.0.65
    
    Args:
        _initPosition: A point or list of points that will act as the origin9s0 of the plane(s) that will be generated.
        refresh_: Connect either a Grasshopper "button" component that will allow you to refresh the plane orientation upon hitting the button or a Grasshopper "Timer" component to see the plane update in real time as you navigate through the Rhino viewport.
    Returns:
        orientedToCam: A plane (or list of planes) for each _initPosition connected. All planes are oriented perpendicular to the active Rhino viewport camera direction and are centered at initPosition points.
