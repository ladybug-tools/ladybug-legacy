                                   If swh system is intended to be used in a non-freezing or light freezing climate (tropical and subtropical regions), then water should be used as a working fluid. The specific heat of water is: 4180 J/kg/C.
                                   -
                                   If swh system is used in freezing climates (temperate, polar...), an antifreeze needs to be added to the water. In most cases this is Propylen glycol, Ethylen glycol or Bio glycol added in certain percentages to the water. Depending on the freezing temperatures of the climates, there are the following specific heats of water-glycol mixtures:
                                   up to -10C:  water-propylenglycol 25%:  4080 J/kg/C.

        flowRatePerM2_: Test flow rate of working fluid through the collector per square meter of collector's area.
                        The higher the flow rate, the higher the collector efficiency is. On the other hand higher flow rates require more pump power, larger pipe diameters and can cause erosion corrosion.

                               -
                               If not supplied maxWorkingTemperature-3C will be used.

                                   In C.
        avrJanuaryColdWaterTemperature_: Average January cold water inlet temperature. This is the temperature of the water from the local pipe grid.
                                      Input it from first item of "Cold Water Temperature" component's "avrColdWaterTemperaturePerMonth" output.
                                      -
                                      If not supplied it will be calculated for the following input data: method "1" (Christensen and Burch), pipes depth from 0.3 to 1 meters.

                                    This input accepts list of values (8760 values or 8767 with heading included) or a single value. If you input a single value, this means that for each 8760 hours during a year, the mechanicalRoomTemperature will correspond to that inputted value.
                                    -

                                    -
                                    If not supplied, a value of 20C degrees will be used for each hour during a year (meaning: storage tank is located inside the building).

                     -
                     If collectors are located on the roof: a rule of a thumb is to add 10 meters for each story (basement is calculated as a story too) and additionally 10 meters for the roof.
                     For example: for a 3 story building with a basement (basement, ground floor, first floor, second floor, roof), if storage tank is located in the basement and collectors are on the roof, the piping length would be: 4 stories * 10m + 10m (on the roof) = 50m.
                     -
                     If collectors are located on the ground, one would have to estimate the distance from the house to collectors and multiply it by 2 (supply pipes go to collectors and return ones from them).
                     -
                     If nothing inputted, a default value of 20 meters will be used (Ground story house without a basement. Collectors are located on a roof, the storage tank is at the ground story).

                       If not supplied, for active swh systems, it will be calculated as:
                       (4 * flowRatePerM2 * collectorActiveArea / flowSpeed / pi), with flowSpeed assumed to be 0.7 liters/sec.
                       -
                       For passive swh systems as:
                       1.5 times the value of upper formula.
                       -
                       In millimetres.
        pipeInsulationThickness_: Thickness of the pipes insulation, in milimeters.
                                  For pipes with insulation thermal conductivity lower than 0.04 W/(m*K), based on pipeDiameter, the following insulation thicknesses can be used:
                                  -
                                  20 mm - pipeDiameter < 22mm
                                  25mm - pipeDiameter 22 to 28mm
                                  30mm - pipeDiameter 28 to 42mm
                                  equal to pipeDiameter - pipeDiameter 42 to 100mm
                                  100mm - pipeDiameter > 100mm
                                  -
                                  If not supplied, it will be calculate based on pipeDiameter and upper criteria.

                    Circulation pumps power depends on SWH active area, flow rate, working fluid, pipe length and its disposition...
                    Generally they range from 30 W for small swh system, up to a couple of hundreds for large ones (SWH active area > 30m2)
                    -
                    In case of passive circulation (thermosyphon, ICS or batch systems), set the pumpPower to 0.
