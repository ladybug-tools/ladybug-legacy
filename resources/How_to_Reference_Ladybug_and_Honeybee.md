Ladybug and Honeybee are two open source plugins for Grasshopper and Rhinoceros that help explore and evaluate environmental performance. Ladybug imports standard EnergyPlus weather files (.EPW) into Grasshopper and provides a variety of 3D interactive graphics to support the decision-making process during the initial stages of design. Honeybee connects the visual programming environment of Grasshopper to four validated simulation engines - specifically, EnergyPlus, Radiance, Daysim and OpenStudio - which evaluate building energy consumption, comfort, and daylighting (Sadeghipour Roudsari M., Pak M., 2013). These plugins enable a dynamic coupling between the flexible, component-based, visual programming interface of Grasshopper and validated environmental data sets and simulation engines.
