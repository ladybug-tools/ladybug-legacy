Ladybug for Grasshopper
========================================
Ladybug is a free and open source environmental plugin for Grasshopper to help designers create an environmentally-conscious architectural design.  The initial step in the design process should be the weather data analysis; a thorough understanding of the weather data will, more likely, lead designers to high-performance design decisions.

Ladybug imports standard EnergyPlus Weather files (.EPW) in Grasshopper and provides a variety of 2D and 3D designer-friendly interactive graphics to support the decision-making process during the initial stages of design. The tool also provides further support for designers to test their initial design options for implications from radiation and sunlight-hours analyses results. Integration with Grasshopper allows for an almost instantaneous feedback on design modifications, and as it runs within the design environment, the information and analysis is interactive.

- More tutorials for Ladybug on (Performance + Form).

"Performance+FORM is a platform to learn, SHARE, and collaborate on projects and WORKFLOWS for environmentally responsive design." The project is started by faculty and students at USC but is open to all. 

### Other tutorials:

- [A pdf tutorial](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bz2PwDvkjovJclJDMHJVMHJWaFU/edit) by Anna Kaertner and Chantal Jahn prepared for the [Building Technology Laboratory Class](http://architecture.mit.edu/subject/fall-2013-4411) at MIT taught by Les Norford. This tutorial goes through almost all of the Ladybug components except the sun-path.
